# Testing the difference of means among groups of marketing channels (TV as the promotion funnel)

In this project, we will be running a one-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) and post hoc test to test the difference of means among groups of marketing channels. 
We previously analysed the historical promotional data of a business that uses TV, social media, radio, and influencer promotion to increase sales.
***Now, the stakeholders want to know if sales are significantly different among various TV and influencer promotion types.***


To address this request, a one-way ANOVA test will enable you to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in sales among groups. This includes:
* Using plots and descriptive statistics to select a categorical independent variable
* Creating and fitting a linear regression model with the selected categorical independent variable
* Checking model assumptions
* Performing and interpreting a one-way ANOVA test
* Comparing pairs of groups using an ANOVA post hoc test
* Interpreting model outputs and communicating the results to nontechnical stakeholders
